Neural Network based AI Learn How To Play Snake, Breakout, and PacMan.

Team: Nathanael L. Mann, Austin Brown, Cooper Martin

Our team re-created three classic arcade-style games in Python using the Pygame Library; Breakout, Snake, and Pac-Man. We then implemented a neural network to learn each of these games using NumPy and allowed it to learn over time through trial and error. We used a combination of shallow neural networks and deep neural networks and found that the simpler variety was sufficient for Breakout, but that even with the added complexity the deep neural network was not able to achieve a perfect score in either Snake or Pacman.
