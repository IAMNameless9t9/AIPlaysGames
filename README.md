Simple Genetic Algorithms &amp; Deep Learning Based AI Learns How To Play Snake, Breakout, and PacMan.

Team: Nathanael L. Mann, Austin Brown, Cooper Martin

For our project, each member will be recreating a classic game using the PyGame library. 
Nathanael will be responsible for Breakout.
Austin will be responsible for Snake.
Cooper will be responsible for Pac-Man. 


THIS IS A TEST OF THE PULL REQUEST SYSTEM.
THIS IS A SECOND TEST.
THIS IS A THIRD TEST.

The goal of the project will be to teach an AI to play each of these games using a combination of Genetic Algorithms and Deep-Q-Learning in order to have the AIs improve over time. Given extra time, we would like to train the AI to play more games, but three seems like a sufficient starting goal.
